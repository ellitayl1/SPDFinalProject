# Smart Neighborhood Exchange

## Project Overview
**Smart Neighborhood Exchange** is a web application designed to promote community resource sharing within local neighborhoods. With an intuitive platform, neighbors can list items and spaces for shared use, fostering a cooperative sharing economy while optimizing resource utilization and reducing unnecessary purchases.

This project is part of the **SPD Fall 2024 Capstone Project** and is designed to provide hands-on experience in full-stack development, enabling students to apply industry-standard practices in backend and frontend development, database management, security, and deployment.

## Objectives
The primary goal of Smart Neighborhood Exchange is to:
- Facilitate the sharing of community resources, such as tools, equipment, and spaces.
- Offer smart scheduling and reservation capabilities.
- Encourage community interaction and cooperation through a sustainable, sharing-focused model.

## Key Features
1. **Resource Sharing and Scheduling**  
   Users can list available items (tools, appliances, etc.) and book them through an integrated calendar.

2. **Community Spaces and Events**  
   Users can reserve community spaces (garages, meeting rooms) and organize events, such as local cleanups.

3. **Smart Notifications**  
   Notifications for reservation confirmations, scheduling conflicts, and due dates are automated.

4. **User Profiles and Reviews**  
   Users have profiles with reputation scores, reviews, and a track record of shared resources and participation.

5. **Security and Trust**  
   Features such as ID verification and privacy controls for personal information help ensure user safety.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js)
- **Database**: SQLite

## Project Requirements
- **Backend**  
  - Database management for users, resources, messages, and reviews.
  - Authentication, CRUD operations, and a search functionality.
  - Server-side validation and error-handling.

- **Frontend**  
  - Responsive web design across all pages.
  - Interactive elements with form validation.
  - User dashboard, listing details, messaging, and review interfaces.

- **Security**  
  - Protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
  - Data validation and secure handling of sensitive user inputs.

## Deployment
While cloud deployment is optional, the application should be runnable locally with setup instructions provided in a `requirements.txt` file for ease of use.

## Documentation
- **Database Schemas and ER Diagrams**  
  Detailed visualizations of the database structure for understanding relationships and data flow.
  
- **User Guide**  
  A comprehensive guide explaining app functionalities, navigation, and user interactions.

- **API Documentation**  
  If applicable, a structured guide for all available APIs.

## Project Timeline
The project spans 18 days with specific milestones:
1. **Planning and Setup**: Create product documentation, wireframes, and initialize the project environment.
2. **Backend Development**: Database design and CRUD functionality.
3. **Frontend Development**: Responsive UI and interaction integration.
4. **Testing, Validation, and Security**: Comprehensive validation and security checks.
5. **Documentation and Final Review**: Complete all documentation, review, and finalize the application.

## Evaluation Criteria
The project will be evaluated on functionality, user experience, code quality, security, and presentation quality, with additional emphasis on robust documentation and overall project management.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the setup guide to initialize the local database and run the application.
